# iConvert
Measurement Converter app made with *SwiftUI*
Extended and optimized version of the ["Challenge 1"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19) from "100 days of SwiftUI" challenge.
The "extension" means more convertible **Units**, **Parent-Child Views** relations within **NavigationView** and more!

In the final build, I've used my knowledge of: 

– **MVVM** and data structuring;

– **Measurement** and **Unit** classes;

– **Dynamic** views creation; 

– **Dark / Light** modes support;
